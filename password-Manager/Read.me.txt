This code creates a Password Manager application using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and JSON for data storage. Here's a more detailed summary:

Search Functionality:

The search_click function allows users to search for saved credentials by website name.
It reads the data from a JSON file (data.json) and displays the email and password if the website is found.
If the file is not found or the website does not exist in the data, it shows an appropriate error message.
Password Generator:

The gen_click function generates a random password.
It combines letters, numbers, and special characters in random quantities and shuffles them to create a secure password.
The generated password is displayed in the password entry field.
Save Password:

The add_click function allows users to save website credentials (website, email, and password) to a JSON file.
It checks if the fields are filled, asks for user confirmation to save the data, and handles file reading/writing.
If the JSON file does not exist, it creates a new one and adds the data. If it exists, it updates the existing data with new entries.
